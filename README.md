This project demonstrates SQL-based data analysis using a sample Ecommerce dataset with SQLite in Google Colab. It includes table creation, data insertion, and queries using SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, views, and indexing. The goal is to practice manipulating structured data and extracting insights using core SQL operations.
